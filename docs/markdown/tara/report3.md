*The Problem*

 Students who attend Sacramento State College seem to have trouble finding a spot to study or do homework.  Students who don’t study or do their assignments tend to not graduate from college.  This is proven by the low graduation rate of 43.3% in 2014.  Since our school is packed with people most of the time, it can be difficult to find a place available to study or do homework.  While it is impossible to make anyone study or do their assignments, our project will help students find places on campus so that they can do their assignments with the amenities they need.
*	Students have busy school/work schedules and it’s hard for them to find time to study
*	Lack of motivation
*	Not being able to find places to study between classes.
*	Not being able to find quiet places to study between classes.
*	Not being able to find a place for a group to work on a project on campus.
*	Unaware of the amenities that can help students work on assignments.
*	No way of knowing real time building/floor availability.

The main problem on campus is finding a spot to study. Many students wonder around throughout the AIRC and the library just trying to find an open spot for either them or their group.  This can result to students becoming stressed out or starting arguments over spots they think are open.  These problems can end up wasting time, which is not ideal, especially with a busy school schedule.

*Our Goal*

Our goal is to make a website that is easy to operate for students to find a spot to study. We also want to foster an active community of students where they are eagerly involved in providing information about the best and worst places to study.

Without this program there would be no way for students to know where the best places to study are, which could lead to students not studying at all which would then lead to students dropping out. We wish to make student's lives easier and also to make school less stressful than it already is.  This program is designed with students in mind, with the simple web layout to the easy to find needed amenities.

With the ideal implementation of our web application, SpotFinder will become a part of every student's daily routine.  The final production build will be good enough to be endorsed by Sacramento State University.  Our web application could be integrated into the Sac State mobile application.  This would allow students to have easy access to our website alongside the many other useful resources within the Sac State App.
