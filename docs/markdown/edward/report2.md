    ## Identifying Subsystems 
    img here

    The three subsystems are the client's browser, the server, and the database.  The client 
    will access the server and the server retrieve data from the database. 

c) 

    ## Mapping Subsystems to Hardware

    There is a server that serves a website.  
    Users are able to access the webpage with a web browser.  The UI that the user interacts with
    is run on the user's computer that is being used to visit the webpage.  The web server 
    runs on a linux machine that is being hosted remotely.

    ## Execution Orderness

     The system is not procedure driven.  The user has the ability to select which part of
     the website that they would like to interact with.  There is no specific order that the 
     client has to interact with the website.  

    ## Time Dependency

    There are automated algorithms that will run at specific times in the day.  
    These are realtime events that occur periodically.  The algorithms are for caching 
    analyzed trends 

    ## Concurrency 

     This system will run on an apache server.  That server will handle multiple requests 
    and allow for serveral users.  The users will all access the same database.  The apache php 
    will be single threaded.

    ## Hardware Requirements

    The system runs on a linux box that is remotely hosted.  The server only needs about 1GB of
     space and a single core allocated to host and serve content.  To use the system, the client needs
    to have a computer capable of visiting a webpage.
